# Project Journal

## Mod 3, Week 1

### 8.17
Created an excalidraw demo wire framework for the whole project. Collaborated with others to refine relationships between microservices 

### 8.19
Continued refining my excalidraw microservice and practiced git commands with branches. 

## Mod 3, Week 2

### 8.23
We talked as a group through our models and wire framework. I refined my microserves and VO's I'd need to pull from. 

### 8.24
We set up our sql tables with Sarah. We had our first stand up. We also solidified our workflow es

## Mod 3, Week 3

### 8.29
I continued to shadow/group-code with the rest of the groups' models and dbs. We decided to go away from a userVO and also to changed the height property from profile to health data - goals. 

### 8.30
I finally got to set up my models, requests and API. I spend most of the day troubleshooting the errors on Swagger. Major blockers at this point are setting up the request for retrieving ONE set of goals for a particular username, and setting up the BMI calculation between data from two different tables. I'll likely have to continue working on this tomorrow. 

### 8.31
I started my front-end js file to get my health data inputs. We fixed an issue with the nav bar not showing up on my form page. I got really bogged down today dealing with internet issues too. 

### 9.1
Started my unittest code. I created the testing directory in the backend/health/api directory.

### 9.2
I didn't have a ton of time dedicated to the project today between lecture and mandatory fun. I joined tables for my BMI calculation output. Added a PUT to my API and troubleshooted with Sarah to get it to work since we both have an update router.

## Mod 3, Week 4

### 9.6
Experimented with the react chart library I wanted to use. It did not come quickly and after some help from a SEIR, I've decided to explore a different library - one with better documentation. I think I was looking at an outdated library that was once popular before a successor came about. I had my Careers 1:1 meeting in the middle of module time, so I didn't get as much done on it. I'm also behind/slow to understand the data structures explorations so I'll be spending a little more time on that tonight.
