# Project Journal

## Mod 3, Week 1

### 8.17
Created an excalidraw demo wire framework for the whole project. Collaborated with others to refine relationships between microservices 

### 8.19
Continued refining my excalidraw microservice and practiced git commands with branches. 

## Mod 3, Week 2

### 8.23
We talked as a group through our models and wire framework. I refined my microserves and VO's I'd need to pull from. 

### 8.24
We set up our sql tables with Sarah. We had our first stand up. We also solidified our workflow es

## Mod 3, Week 3

### 8.29
I continued to shadow/group-code with the rest of the groups' models and dbs. We decided to go away from a userVO and also to changed the height property from profile to health data - goals. 

### 8.30
I finally got to set up my models, requests and API. I spend most of the day troubleshooting the errors on Swagger. Major blockers at this point are setting up the request for retrieving ONE set of goals for a particular username, and setting up the BMI calculation between data from two different tables. I'll likely have to continue working on this tomorrow. 

### 8.31
I started my front-end js file to get my health data inputs. We fixed an issue with the nav bar not showing up on my form page. I got really bogged down today dealing with internet issues too. 

### 9.1
Started my unittest code. I created the testing directory in the backend/health/api directory.

### 9.2
I didn't have a ton of time dedicated to the project today between lecture and mandatory fun. I joined tables for my BMI calculation output. Added a PUT to my API and troubleshooted with Sarah to get it to work since we both have an update router.

## Mod 3, Week 4

### 9.6
Experimented with the react chart library I wanted to use. It did not come quickly and after some help from a SEIR, I've decided to explore a different library - one with better documentation. I think I was looking at an outdated library that was once popular before a successor came about. I had my Careers 1:1 meeting in the middle of module time, so I didn't get as much done on it. I'm also behind/slow to understand the data structures explorations so I'll be spending a little more time on that tonight. 


## Mod 3, Week 5

### 9.12
I was able to get data points to render on the chartjs! I'm finishing my unit test this afternoon. I was also able to get the data to be specific to a user.

### 9.13
AUTH DAY!!! Sarah really helped today as we made sure all of the pages and routers that needed authentication got it. Lots of share screen today so that we could troubleshoot through each other's errors. I had an issue were my form input was set to submit instead of "button". This caused a big issue with the function continuously being called and REALLY slowing the page down. Zach was able to help me figure that out. I had some silly git issues, which you'll see in the commit log. I kept forgetting to go back to my branch. After having so many docker containers open at this point in our project, I'm starting to think that I'll need a more powerful computer. At one point today, I completely overloaded my working memory and my computer crashed. I have a fairly new MacBook Pro (2020) with 8GB RAM. 

### 9.14
PREVIEW WITH DALONTE DAY! I was able to get my submit button figured out - it turns out that, at the moment, it doesn't respond to the 'enter' button, but only on click. Chalking that up to a stretch goal. I was also able to create and implement my graph as a widget on the main dashboard page. With a little help from the SEIRs, I got it positioned the way I wanted within the Tailwind card. Preview went well with Dalonte and it seems like all that's left is some documentation and cleaning up things here an there. 

### 9.15
It's been a slow Thursday. We're combing back through the project requirements and making sure all of the documentation is taken care of. I updated the README and added my wireframe to the docs folder. I'll be adding my API markdown here soon.
