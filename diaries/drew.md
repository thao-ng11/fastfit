I continued to shadow/group-code with the rest of the groups' models and dbs. We decided to go away from a userVO and also to changed the height property from profile to health data - goals. 

### 8.30
I finally got to set up my models, requests and API. I spend most of the day troubleshooting the errors on Swagger.

I'll likely have to continue working on this tomorrow. 

### 8.31
I started my front-end js file to get my health data inputs. We fixed an issue with the nav bar not showing up on my form page.
