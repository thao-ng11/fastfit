The team worked together to design all the db tables in the data_model.md file. We expanded on each of our microservices to confirm the data we need to store in the db and are ready to design the db sql files tomorrow.

Today I explored the Edamam API I'm using to determine what kind of information is available and how the data can be filtered. I used a test django project to practice pulling the data and created the anti-corruption layers. I excalidrawed my recipes front end design and determined the models/database tables needed.
