Today was the first day of planning! I started creating my models and how I want it to look on the frontend on exacildraw. The more I did it, the more I had to think about it and it became more complicated. Using exacildraw was a super helpful tool in order to conceptualize what exactly worked with what and what I wanted to do. Hopefully next week we can start the DB and docker files.

Today we created the data models based off of the excalidraw I created on Friday. Again, doing the data models allowed me to fully think about the VOs and how I would want to design my tables on the DB. Our team also created our branches so we can work separately.

Today was a pretty rough day. Ryan was testing the AUTH stuff and working through the cookbook and it caused a major error. This caused us to be delayed around 2-3 hours because it was done on the main branch. Lesson learned: Do anything on your own branch before trying on the main. Hopefully tomorrow we can figure it out and start on the DB.

We finished up the DB and created the tables for each of our microservices. We started making our functions for our FastAPI backend to be able to query through the database we just created. We also messed with Trello, applying better industry practice with standups. Tomorrow I am hoping to finish up the entire backend, test it all on the FastAPI website which would leave me plenty of time to get started on the frontend next week.

8/25

Finished up the pollers this am, and created the docker containers for each poller. 12 total so far! I am finally getting better at git. 

8/26

Finished up all of the GET and POSTs for all 4 of my models by lunch! After lunch I will be trying to finish up the PUT and DELETEs for my two workout models. Hopefully I can have it all done by tonight or tomorrow at the latest so I can start the Front end by Wednesday.

Finished up all of the PUTs. Cooper gave a good lecture on Tailwind, seems like a pretty easy CSS to use for our projcet. Excited to finally start the Frontend soon!

Finally started FrontEnd Today, wahoo! I got about 50% of the way done with it, just need to implement another form and list then it will be complete! Last thing I would need to do is some CSS. Hopefully by the middle of next week I can finish up my part of the MVP and start doing some stretch goals.
