Today was the first day of planning! I started creating my models and how I want it to look on the frontend on exacildraw. The more I did it, the more I had to think about it and it became more complicated. Using exacildraw was a super helpful tool in order to conceptualize what exactly worked with what and what I wanted to do. Hopefully next week we can start the DB and docker files.

Today we created the data models based off of the excalidraw I created on Friday. Again, doing the data models allowed me to fully think about the VOs and how I would want to design my tables on the DB. Our team also created our branches so we can work separately.

Today was a pretty rough day. Ryan was testing the AUTH stuff and working through the cookbook and it caused a major error. This caused us to be delayed around 2-3 hours because it was done on the main branch. Lesson learned: Do anything on your own branch before trying on the main. Hopefully tomorrow we can figure it out and start on the DB.

We finished up the DB and created the tables for each of our microservices. We started making our functions for our FastAPI backend to be able to query through the database we just created. We also messed with Trello, applying better industry practice with standups. Tomorrow I am hoping to finish up the entire backend, test it all on the FastAPI website which would leave me plenty of time to get started on the frontend next week.
